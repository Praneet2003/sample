# Sample
Hello everyone<br>
This is my demo repository to learn git and github.<br>
First we have to link our local system with github:<br>
To do it we will have to use the following command in terminal: git clone "Link of your repository"<br>
steps are as follows:<br>
Cd file name<br>
git status<br>
//make some changes//<br>
git add filename<br>
git commit -m "config msg"<br>
git push origin main<br>
